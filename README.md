## 3. Insights Overview

**Q1: What is the distribution of house sale prices in the market?**
     
**Answer:** Based on the histogram with the KDE curve, the sales price is right-skewed, showing that most housing prices fall between $100,000 to $250,000 which is below the average. The observed graph also shows some utliers on the higer end that are above $500,000. It is important to note that the dataset used is from 2016, as such current market prices post COVID is not reflected.

**Q2: Are newer rental units being built in specific zoning classifications? And Why?**

**Q3: How are the YearRemodAdd and Heating columns related?**

**Q4: What is the relationship between property functionality and property full bath amounts?**

**Q5: How does the number of garage cars significantly influence house prices?**

**Answer:** The number of garage cars statistically significantly influences house prices. A correlation matrix showed that GarageCars (r = 0.64) had the strongest positive correlations with SalePrice, indicating a moderate relationship. 
A boxplot showed that median house prices increase consistently from 0 to 3-car garages, with a notable jump for 3-car garagesâ€”homes in this category had the highest median sale prices and the widest price range, including many high-end outliers. 
Although other features like porch size or pool area showed little correlation, the Pearson correlation test between GarageCars and SalePrice produced a p-value of 0.000 (p < 0.05), confirming the relationship is statistically significant. This suggests that homes with larger garage capacity tend to command higher prices, though other factors also contribute.
